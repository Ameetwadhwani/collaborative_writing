He didn't know why they were there... but they were.
He stared deep into the pigeons eyes and wondered why it was wearing sunglasses.

The pigeon was a blind bird because a kid poked it's eyes out when it tried to eat her ice cream cone. Shiitttt. 

The blind pigeon flew into an open window at Bitmaker Labs.

And the call was made to 911 for pigeon rescue

The Animal Rescue department came with all sirens blarring.
